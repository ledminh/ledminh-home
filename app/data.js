    summary: `As a full Stack Web Developer who bases in the Bay Area and recently graduated
              with an Associate Degree in Computer Science from De Anza College, I have been

              D3, mongoDB, Express and SCSS for almost 2 years. \\br

              I’m looking for a job that I am passionate about and will help me improve my skills
              on programming, communication and teamwork. I’m also seeking for the

    summary: `Back in VietNam, I was a radiologist. After graduate from medical school in 2007,
              I continued to study to get a certificate in abdomen ultrasonography and then have been working
              for 3 years as a radiologist in Nguyen Trai Hospital. But then, I felt my career would lead
              to nowhere if I continued. So, I quit my job and went to the U.S to follow my passion since
              I was a kid, which is computer science. \\br

              I'm also the founder and administrator of one of the first online medical forum in VietNam for
              seven years, from 2002 to 2009.`
